# Dynamic-Matrix-Multiplication-using-Reinforcement-Learning
Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in numerous scientific, engineering, and machine learning applications. However, the computational complexity associated with large-scale matrix multiplication can significantly slow down processing, especially in data-intensive tasks. This project aims to accelerate matrix multiplication by exploring advanced optimization techniques to achieve faster performance. By addressing the inherent computational bottlenecks in traditional matrix multiplication, this work seeks to minimize execution time and enhance efficiency across different use cases. The focus of this project is to develop an approach that dynamically optimizes the multiplication process without relying on a single fixed algorithm. Instead, it intelligently adapts to the specific characteristics of the matrices involved and the computational environment to achieve better overall performance. The objective is to ensure that the proposed method offers improved speed while maintaining accuracy and scalability for both small and large matrix sizes. This project contributes to the ongoing efforts to improve the practicality of matrix multiplication in various fields such as machine learning, computer graphics, and scientific computing. By reducing computation times, the results of this research have the potential to significantly benefit applications that rely heavily on matrix operations, ultimately leading to faster and more efficient processing in real-world tasks.
